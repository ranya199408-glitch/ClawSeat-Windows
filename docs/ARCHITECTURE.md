# ClawSeat Architecture

## Goal

ClawSeat is a reusable skill-first multi-agent control plane for running
project-scoped AI teams with durable task state.

## Mental Model

The preferred external mental model (v0.7):

- ClawSeat is CLI-first. `scripts/install.sh` is the canonical entrypoint and
  drives the [v0.7 install playbook](INSTALL.md)
- Fresh install writes validated state, launches project `memory` in the
  memories window, opens the workers window, and hands project runtime
  ownership to `memory` after the operator pastes the Phase-A prompt
- `memory` is the primary seat. `operator ↔ memory` is a direct CLI channel
  inside the tmux pane — Feishu is **not** in this path
- `koder` is an optional **reverse channel**: an OpenClaw agent overlaid via
  `scripts/apply-koder-overlay.sh` that subscribes to Feishu and forwards
  operator messages back to a ClawSeat seat via `tmux send-keys`. Koder is
  **not** a ClawSeat seat, is **not** in the workers window, and plays no role
  during install
- ClawSeat → Feishu is **write-only async broadcast** (planner stop-hook +
  memory skill-driven), used for phone-side visibility. No ClawSeat seat
  subscribes to Feishu
- `/cs` is the local shorthand for the playbook's `Resume / Re-entry`
  contract after install state already exists

The implementation model is:

- the skill is only the entrypoint
- the real system also includes the control plane, runtime contracts, transport
  helpers, adapters, and project fixtures

Its core abstractions are:

- `project`
- `seat`
- `session`
- `workspace`
- `runtime`
- `handoff`

## Layers

### 1. Control Plane

Owns:

- project creation/bootstrap
- seat/session lifecycle
- auth/runtime switching
- tmux/iTerm window layout
- workspace contract rendering

Primary home — **split into focused modules (2026-04 refactor, commit `0e8999c`)**:

- `core/scripts/agent_admin.py` — dispatcher + top-level main; wires the hook dataclasses
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_config.py` — paths, `SUPPORTED_RUNTIME_MATRIX`, `CodexProviderConfig` schema, backend CLI binary resolution
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_runtime.py` — env/secret/identity helpers, codex `config.toml` renderer
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_store.py` — project/engineer/session TOML I/O
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_crud.py` — engineer create / rebind / delete
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_session.py` — seat start/stop lifecycle
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_switch.py` — harness/auth switch-in-place
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_resolve.py` — seat resolution + provider seed
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_template.py` — template rendering (workspace contracts)
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_workspace.py` — workspace-guide / role / skill-catalog fragments
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_window.py` — iTerm / tmux window layouts
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_heartbeat.py` — heartbeat provision + receipt
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_commands.py` — top-level CLI command handlers
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_info.py` — engineer/session summary formatters
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_parser.py` — argparse wiring
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_legacy.py` — **imported lazily** from `agent_admin.py` only when a migration operation runs (audit H8); archive_if_exists is inlined on the hot path
- `core/scripts/agent_admin_tui.py` — optional Textual UI

### 2. Runtime Contract Layer

Owns:

- seat contract
- workspace contract
- heartbeat manifest / receipt
- dispatch / completion / ACK model
- seat transport routing (tmux / OpenClaw-Feishu / file-only)

Primary home:

- `core/harness_adapter.py` — abstract HarnessAdapter Protocol
- `core/templates/` — role template TOMLs
- `core/skills/gstack-harness/` — canonical runtime skill (see §3)
- `core/transport/transport_router.py` — **single entry point for dispatch/notify/complete/render-console** (audit H1). Routes to either `core/migration/*_dynamic.py` (dynamic-roster profiles) or `core/skills/gstack-harness/scripts/*.py` (legacy profiles) based on `[dynamic_roster].enabled`. Do not import the underlying scripts directly.
- `core/migration/` — dynamic-roster siblings for `dispatch_task` / `notify_seat` / `complete_handoff` / `render_console`. Share `_task_io.build_notify_payload` and other helpers via `dynamic_common.BASE_COMMON` (audit H2). Anti-drift is enforced by `tests/test_transport_router.py::test_shared_task_io_helpers_do_not_fork` over the full list in `SHARED_TASK_IO_HELPERS` — if you fork a helper into `dynamic_common.py` instead of re-exporting, that test fails.
- `core/lib/seat_resolver.py` — tmux vs openclaw vs file-only routing hook used by notify_seat + complete_handoff (upstream T19)
- `core/engine/instantiate_seat.py` — seat materialization: workspace + symlinks + session records + tmux config

#### Layered runtime model (v0.7 semantics)

The v2 profile validator still enforces the layered split introduced in v0.4,
but the operational story in v0.7 is the install playbook in
[`docs/INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md): `scripts/install.sh` writes validated state
and launches `memory`; operator pastes the Phase-A prompt, then `memory`
finishes Phase-A. See
[`schemas/v0.4-layered-model.md`](schemas/v0.4-layered-model.md) for the
underlying schema background (note: some `koder-as-frontstage` wording there
is legacy; v0.7 reframes koder as the Feishu reverse channel — see §Mental Model).

| Layer | Seat(s) | Runtime |
|---|---|---|
| Machine | no global seat | machine facts are scan artifacts under `~/.agents/memory/machine/`; the v1 global memory daemon is legacy compat only |
| Tenant (optional) | `koder` (one per OpenClaw/Feishu tenant, overlaid on existing OpenClaw agent) | Feishu reverse channel; lives on the OpenClaw side; never a tmux seat; never part of install |
| Project | `memory`, `planner`, `builder`, `reviewer`, `patrol` | tmux `<project>-<seat>`; memory lives in the shared memories window, workers live in the per-project workers window; memory owns lifecycle; numbered/fan-out sessions are optional extensions |

Verification uses the canonical `patrol` seat. Legacy verification-seat names
were removed on 2026-04-29.

Legacy v1 profile templates are no longer shipped in-tree — they depended on
`heartbeat_*` fields the v2 validator rejects. Current v0.7 install is
script-first: `scripts/install.sh` + [`docs/INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) write the
validated v2 profile, open the workers and memories windows, start memory, and
hand off to `memory`.
There is no separate install wizard or `/cs` bootstrap path.

### 3. Skill Layer

Owns:

- dispatch helper
- completion helper
- patrol / console
- seat launch protocol

Primary home:

- `core/skills/gstack-harness/`

#### Entry-point skill boundaries

Three ClawSeat-owned entry-point skills share the `clawseat*` / `cs` namespace.
Their responsibilities are deliberately non-overlapping — if you are unsure
which one to edit, use this table before you touch either:

| Skill | Role | Invoked by | Writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clawseat` | Product entrypoint. Detects runtime, routes fresh installs to the v0.7 playbook (`scripts/install.sh`), and keeps frontstage semantics straight. | OpenClaw / Feishu / Claude Code / Codex when the user says "启动 ClawSeat" or "install ClawSeat" | Nothing directly; delegates to `clawseat-install` |
| `clawseat-install` | v0.7 install playbook. Calls `scripts/install.sh` which drives host bootstrap + environment scan + workers window + memories window; memory then runs Phase-A per `docs/INSTALL.md`. | Claude Code / Codex / OpenClaw runtimes when the user asks to install ClawSeat | `~/.agents/projects/<project>/project.toml`, `project-local.toml`, install artifacts under `~/.agents/tasks/<project>/install/`, entry-skill symlinks in `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.codex/skills/` |
| `cs` | Local `/cs` convenience alias (**post-install only**). Re-entry shorthand for the `docs/INSTALL.md` `Resume / Re-entry` section; reuses existing install state and relaunches memory if needed. | User in a local Claude Code / Codex session after install state already exists | Minimal — may relaunch memory/session state, but must not create project/profile/binding from scratch |

The default v2 project story is `memory` with a rotating worker set (`planner`,
`builder`, optional `reviewer`, `writer`, `visual`, and/or `patrol`) depending
on the selected template. Numbered seats such as `builder-1` belong to fan-out
or migration examples, not the top-level narrative.

Invariant — do not cross the boundaries:

- `clawseat` must not write install state (no `~/.agents/*` writes; delegate to `clawseat-install`)
- `clawseat-install` must not read from `PLANNER_BRIEF` (it runs before seats exist)
- `cs` must fail fast if the `install` project state is missing or invalid; it may relaunch memory, but it must not create the canonical install project, synthesize profile/binding state, or start planner directly

## §3z — Seat lifecycle entry points (v0.7 Pyramid)

ClawSeat exposes **three layers** for seat lifecycle. Use the highest layer
that fits your scenario; never call a lower layer directly unless you have
read the ones above and confirmed they do not cover your case.

| Layer | Component | When to use | Don't use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 — User-facing entry** | `scripts/install.sh` (bootstrap), `scripts/apply-koder-overlay.sh` (post-install Feishu reverse channel) | Operator wants to bootstrap a fresh project, or apply koder overlay after install | You only need to (re)start one seat — use L2 instead |
| **L2 — CLI operations** | `agent_admin session start-engineer`, `agent_admin project bootstrap`, `agent_admin project use`, `agent_admin project delete` | Restarting one seat, switching project context, killing a project group | Doing one-time install — use L1 |
| **L3 — Execution primitive** | `core/launchers/agent-launcher.sh` | **INTERNAL only**. Called by L1 / L2 when actually launching a seat process. Handles sandbox HOME, secrets file, runtime_dir under `~/.agent-runtime/identities/<tool>/<auth>/<id>/home/` | You are a user or agent — go through L1 / L2 |

### Sandbox HOME isolation contract

Every seat launched via L1 or L2 inherits a sandbox HOME at
`~/.agent-runtime/identities/<tool>/<auth>/<auth_mode>-<session_name>/home/`,
giving per-seat credential / config isolation. Direct `tmux new-session bash`
from a script bypasses this contract — never do it for a seat that runs
`claude` / `codex` / `gemini`.

### Claude API Secrets Dual-Path

Claude API provider secrets are intentionally written in two locations:

- `~/.agent-runtime/secrets/claude/<provider>.env` is the launcher-visible
  shared provider file.
- `~/.agents/secrets/claude/<provider>/<seat>.env` is the seat-specific file
  referenced from `session.toml` and consumed by `agent-admin`.

Install keeps these paths in sync during template-driven seeding, but a real
`sk-...` token in either path must not be overwritten by a placeholder such as
`<MINIMAX_TOKEN>` or `<set-by-operator>`. Missing shared provider files may be
created from the selected provider key, then copied into each matching seat
secret.

### When to call which `init_*.py`

These are NOT user-facing entry points. They are called from L1 / L2 / Phase-A:

| Script | Called by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `init_koder.py` | `apply-koder-overlay.sh` | Destructive overlay onto an OpenClaw agent workspace |
| `install_memory_hook.py` | `install.sh` Step 7.5 | Install Stop hook into memory's workspace |
| `install_planner_hook.py` | `memory` Phase-A B3.5 | Install Stop hook into planner's workspace |

### 4. Adapter Layer

Owns:

- project-specific seat rules
- project-specific handoff conventions
- project-specific startup notes

Examples:

- `adapters/projects/myproject/`
- `adapters/projects/openclaw/`

### 5. Sample / Fixture Layer

Owns:

- smoke-test projects
- example profiles
- migration fixtures

## Current Migration Status

Already inside ClawSeat:

- control plane (`core/scripts/agent_admin*.py`, split into 15 focused modules as of 2026-04)
- core harness (`core/skills/gstack-harness/` runtime + `core/migration/` dynamic-roster siblings)
- canonical transport router (`core/transport/transport_router.py`; dead `core/transport.py` removed in audit H1)
- shared transport helpers (`core/shell-scripts/`, with input validation on `send-and-verify.sh` — audit H3)
- harness adapter interface + tmux-cli implementation (`core/harness_adapter.py`, `adapters/harness/tmux-cli/`)
- shared shell shim base (`shells/_shim_base.py`; each bundle under `shells/*/adapter_shim.py` is a thin wrapper — audit M1)
- memory-oracle skill (`core/skills/memory-oracle/`, introduced in upstream T7/T22)
- Project adapter (`adapters/projects/<project>/`)

Recent structural changes:

- **2026-04 — agent_admin split (commit `0e8999c`)** — monolith → 15 focused modules.
- **2026-04 — gstack-harness runtime embedded (commit `b35bfc0`)** — `core/skills/gstack-harness/scripts/` now carries the runtime scripts once shared with an external gstack checkout.
- **2026-04 — core/migration/ layer** — houses `*_dynamic.py` scripts that replace the legacy harness scripts for profiles with `[dynamic_roster].enabled = true`. Traffic flows through `core/transport/transport_router.py` so callers never pick the wrong path by hand.
- **2026-04 — transport/payload consolidation (audit P0/P1)** — `build_notify_payload` extracted into `_task_io.py`, rendering/validation for codex provider config moved into a typed `CodexProviderConfig` dataclass, shells/*/adapter_shim.py collapsed onto `_shim_base.py`.
- **2026-04 — install.sh enhancements** — `--repo-root` flag (FR-7) allows installing a project pointing to a different business repo (separate from the ClawSeat root); `--reset-harness-memory` clears per-seat harness choice history (FR-1 `last-harness.toml` persistence). `CLAWSEAT_FEISHU_ENABLED=0` env var disables all Feishu sends globally (send_delegation_report, planner stop-hook, announce helpers).
- **2026-04 — project templates** — `--template` flag selects one of three built-in rosters: `clawseat-engineering` (5-seat with reviewer), `clawseat-creative` (5-seat cartooner-bound creative team), or `clawseat-solo` (3-seat). `PENDING_SEATS` and `seat_order` are now read dynamically from the template TOML; per-seat tool/auth/provider override each seat is carried into `project-local.toml`.

### Project Templates

Three built-in project templates in `templates/`:

| Template | Seats | Count | Use case |
|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| `clawseat-engineering` | memory planner builder reviewer patrol | 5 | Engineering chain with reviewer (QA + visual review); seats use gstack-harness protocol + gstack skills |
| `clawseat-creative` | memory writer builder-image builder-av patrol | 5 | Cartooner-bound creative team for short films, short dramas, MV; seats use cartooner skills (image / video / audio / storyboard / design / prompt); cartooner-harness protocol layer |
| `clawseat-solo` | memory (claude oauth) + builder (codex oauth) + planner (gemini oauth) | 3 | Minimal collaboration chain with standard brief -> workflow -> dispatch -> verdict cycle |

### Solo Template (Minimal 3-Seat)

`clawseat-solo` is a 3-seat alternative for minimal OAuth-only collaboration:

| Seat | Tool | Role |
|------|------|------|
| memory | claude oauth | L3 hub, brief authoring, verdict |
| builder | codex oauth | Implementation |
| planner | gemini oauth | Workflow orchestration, dispatch |

No reviewer, patrol, or designer seats. Memory delegates orchestration to planner;
builder self-reviews; memory issues final verdict. All seats use OAuth - no API
keys required.

**Creative template seat responsibilities** (`clawseat-creative`, cartooner-harness-bound):
- `memory` (claude/minimax-api, **Vision Steward**): no-image-policy; maintains PROJECT_INDEX / generation_log via metadata only; coordinates lanes; escalates aesthetic decisions to user. MiniMax chosen for high-frequency long-session work without OAuth quota pressure.
- `writer` (claude/oauth, **Story Specialist**): pure literary — narrative_outline.md (scenes / dialogue / character beats); never writes shot lists or prompts. Claude OAuth chosen for strongest Chinese narrative quality.
- `builder-image` (codex/oauth, **Image Specialist**): reads shot_list.toml + style_bible; translates each shot into model-specific image prompt; runs cartooner-image / -storyboard / -design with nano-banana / gpt-image-2 fallback.
- `builder-av` (gemini/oauth, **AV Cinematographer**): owns shot_list authoring AND av generation. Gemini chosen for one killer feature: YouTube ingestion via reference-learning subagent (master cinematographer reference learning).
- `patrol` (claude/minimax-api, **Asset Guardian**): file-level integrity only — PROJECT_INDEX schema, asset existence / size / hash, cartooner pipeline SLA monitoring; never reads asset content.

> The creative template uses `cartooner-harness` (not `gstack-harness`) as its protocol layer. The creative workflow's primitives (lane / deposit / pick / iterate) differ structurally from the engineering chain's (dispatch / handoff / ack), so the protocol layers are intentionally split. See `core/skills/cartooner-harness/SKILL.md`.

Still outside ClawSeat by design:

- the full product source tree for any consumer project
- the full `openclaw` product source tree

## §3b — state.db: Single-Source-of-Truth Ledger (C8)

### Why state.db

Prior to C8, answering "where is seat X and what is it doing?" required grepping
six separate artefacts: `session.toml`, project TOML files,
`patrol/handoffs/*.json`, `openclaw.json`, and
`~/.agents/sessions/…`. Four concrete pain points drove the consolidation:

1. **Dispatcher blindness** — `dispatch_task.py` hardcodes `builder-1`; other
   builder seats idle because no index exists of live seats and their load.
2. **Silent chain stalls** — Feishu closeouts depend on planner remembering to
   call `send_delegation_report.py`; a missed call stalls the chain silently.
3. **Scattered state** — Six files, none authoritative, each requiring custom
   regex to reconstruct seat status.
4. **Manual deploy sync** — `~/.clawseat/` is an independent git clone; code
   changes require a manual `git pull` on both sides to stay in sync.

`state.db` is a single SQLite file at `~/.agents/state.db` that provides a
derived, queryable view over all six artefacts. In C8 it is **read-only** from
production paths; existing artefacts remain authoritative.

### Schema (ER summary)

```
projects ──< seats ─< tasks
                            \
                             events (append-only log)

projects  : name (PK), feishu_group_id, feishu_bot_account, repo_root,
            heartbeat_owner, active_loop_owner, bound_at
seats     : (project, seat_id) PK, role, tool, auth_mode, provider,
            status, last_heartbeat, session_name, workspace
tasks     : id PK, project, source, target, role_hint, status,
            title, correlation_id, opened_at, closed_at, disposition
events    : id AUTOINCREMENT, ts, type, project, payload_json
```

Indexes: `idx_seats_status(project, role, status)`,
`idx_tasks_open(project, target, status)`, `idx_events_ts(ts)`.

### Read/write flow

```
operator / C9 dispatcher
        │
        ▼
core/lib/state.py  (stdlib sqlite3 — no ORM, no external deps)
        │
        ▼
~/.agents/state.db  (WAL mode, foreign_keys=ON)
```

All public API functions accept a `conn: sqlite3.Connection` as their first
argument for testability. `open_db(db_path=None)` auto-applies the schema on
first call via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`; re-opening is a no-op.

`seed_from_filesystem(home, *, conn)` reads the six legacy artefacts and
populates the DB idempotently. It is safe to re-run at any time: `upsert_*`
uses `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`; `record_task_dispatched` uses
`INSERT OR IGNORE` so completed tasks never lose their `disposition`.

The operator CLI is `core/scripts/state_admin.py`:

```bash
state-admin seed                          # populate from filesystem
state-admin show-seats [--project X]      # list seats
state-admin show-tasks [--project X] [--status open]
state-admin pick --project X --role builder
state-admin recent-events [--limit 20]
```

### C9: dispatcher wired to state.db (landed)

`dispatch_task.py` (and its dynamic variant `dispatch_task_dynamic.py`) now
accept a `--target-role ROLE` flag as a mutually-exclusive alternative to
`--target SEAT_ID`. When `--target-role` is used:

1. The profile is loaded to get `project_name`.
2. `pick_least_busy_seat(conn, project, role)` is called against state.db.
3. If no live seat matches, the process exits with **rc=3** (`seat_needed`).
4. Otherwise, the resolved `seat_id` is used for the rest of the dispatch.

Both dispatch and completion write to state.db in a **defensive try/except**:
DB failures emit a `warn:` to stderr but never fail the primary dispatch or
handoff. The ledger is still supplementary in C9.

`complete_handoff.py` (and `complete_handoff_dynamic.py`) call
`mark_task_completed` + record a `task.completed` event on every successful
completion, same defensive posture.

The `CLAWSEAT_STATE_DB` env var overrides the default `~/.agents/state.db`
path in `open_db()` — used by all tests for isolation.

### Forward roadmap

- **C10** — events table gains a watcher that materialises closeouts and
  notifications from events rather than ad-hoc writes. ✅ see §3c.
- **C11** — `feishu-announcer` subscribes to events, replaces manual
  `send_delegation_report.py` calls.

---

## §3c — Events Watcher: Subscription Seed (C10)

C8 built the events table. C9 wired `dispatch_task.py` and
`complete_handoff.py` to write events directly from their own code paths.
C10 adds a **passive watcher** (`core/scripts/events_watcher.py`) that
re-derives events from the handoff JSONs on disk — decoupling event
emission from the scripts that write handoffs.

### Why redundant coverage matters

- Legacy code paths (`notify_seat.py`, shell-based dispatches, third-party
  scripts) don't know about state.db — but they all still write handoff
  JSONs under `~/.agents/tasks/<project>/patrol/handoffs/`. Without a
  watcher, their activity is invisible in the events table.
- Defensive retries: if state.db was unavailable when dispatch_task.py
  ran (C9's try/except fallback), the event was lost. The watcher picks
  it up on the next cycle.
- C11 foundation: `feishu-announcer` subscribes to the events stream; a
  richer stream (including legacy tools) makes the subscriber more useful.

### Fingerprint-based deduplication

Each handoff JSON produces a 16-char sha1 fingerprint from
`project|task_id|kind|source|target`. The watcher uses
`record_event_if_new(fingerprint=…)` — a new helper in `state.py` — which
only inserts if no existing row carries that fingerprint. The events
table gains a `fingerprint TEXT` column + index for the lookup; rows
written by C9's direct `record_event()` calls leave fingerprint NULL and
never collide (they're distinct rows by design).

Schema migration for pre-C10 installs: `open_db()` runs
`ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN fingerprint TEXT` wrapped in try/except
so re-open is still a no-op.

### Operator mental model

- `--once` — one-shot sweep, suitable for cron or manual use.
- `--watch --interval 30` — daemon mode, SIGINT-clean, polling (no
  inotify/launchd in v1).
- `--dry-run` — preview plan without DB writes.
- `--project install` — scope to a single project directory.

Direct `record_event()` calls in dispatch/completion remain in place —
watcher is **redundant coverage, not replacement**. Deprecation of the
direct writes is a C11 follow-up.

### Event derivation rules

| handoff `kind`               | event `type`        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `dispatch`                   | `task.dispatched`   |
| `completion`                 | `task.completed`    |
| `learning`                   | `patrol.learning`   |
| `notice`/`reminder`/`unblock` | `seat.notified`    |
| anything else                 | `handoff.unknown` (+ stderr warning) |

---

## §3d — Feishu Announcer: First Event-Bus Subscriber (C11)

### Closing the C8 → C9 → C10 → C11 loop

C8 built the `events` table. C9 wired `dispatch_task.py` and
`complete_handoff.py` to write events directly. C10 added a passive watcher
that re-ingests handoff JSONs via fingerprint deduplication. C11 closes the
loop: `core/scripts/feishu_announcer.py` is the **first real subscriber** —
it reads events and sends Feishu delegation-report envelopes automatically.

Before C11, the planner was responsible for remembering to call
`send_delegation_report.py` on every completion. That obligation caused two
silent chain stalls (C8 and C9 closeouts were missed). C11 makes the
notification path **event-driven**: any event of type `task.completed` or
`chain.closeout` is picked up and announced, regardless of which code path
wrote it.

### feishu_sent column and retry semantics

The `events` table gains a `feishu_sent TEXT` column (ISO8601 timestamp).

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NULL` | Pending — not yet sent, or send failed, will be retried |
| ISO8601 string | Sent successfully at that UTC time |

`open_db()` applies the migration (`ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN feishu_sent
TEXT`) wrapped in `try/except` so re-opening is a no-op. A partial index
`idx_events_feishu_pending ON events(type, feishu_sent) WHERE feishu_sent IS
NULL` keeps the `SELECT` fast even as the events table grows.

Key helpers in `core/lib/state.py`:
- `list_unsent_feishu_events(conn, *, event_types, limit, project)` — returns
  events ordered by `ts ASC` where `feishu_sent IS NULL` and `type IN (…)`.
- `mark_feishu_sent(conn, event_id, ts)` — sets `feishu_sent` on success.

### Announcer modes

```
feishu_announcer.py --once                    # process all pending, exit
feishu_announcer.py --watch [--interval 60]   # loop until SIGINT
feishu_announcer.py --dry-run                 # print envelopes, do not send
feishu_announcer.py --project install         # scope to one project
feishu_announcer.py --types task.completed,chain.closeout
```

On each cycle the announcer calls `_feishu.send_feishu_user_message` and:
- On `status=sent` → calls `mark_feishu_sent`, increments sent count.
- On `status=failed` or any exception → leaves `feishu_sent=NULL`, logs to
  stderr, increments retrying count. The event will be retried on the next
  cycle. The loop never crashes mid-batch.

`SIGINT` is handled cleanly in `--watch` mode: the loop stops after the
current cycle and prints a final tally.

### Why direct send_delegation_report.py calls are NOT yet removed

`dispatch_task.py` and `complete_handoff.py` still contain
`_try_announce_planner_event()` helpers that call `send_delegation_report.py`
directly. These are **not removed in C11** — the announcer needs to prove
itself in the field first. Once C11 is stable and lark-cli auth is refreshed,
those helpers will be removed in C11-v2. Until then, the direct calls act as a
fallback and may produce duplicate Feishu messages (which is preferable to
silent stalls).

---

## §3e — Heartbeat cron (C12)

### Problem

OpenClaw frontstage (koder) is dormant unless the user types. In long-running
projects, koder can sit idle for hours without performing patrol. C12 adds an
automatic wake-up mechanism using launchd + Feishu.

### Design

```

```

This C12 path is only active when the optional koder overlay has been applied
(`scripts/apply-koder-overlay.sh`) and the project has a `feishu_group_id`.
In pure CLI-only mode (v0.7 default), heartbeat patrol is driven by the
memory patrol skill, not via Feishu.

The beacon script is purely bash + lark-cli — it does not call Python or pull
in any ClawSeat dependencies. It runs in the operator's laptop launchd
environment, not inside a seat workspace.

### Config schema

`~/.agents/heartbeat/<project>.toml`:

```toml
version = 1
project = "install"
enabled = true
cadence = "10min"         # 5min / 30m / 1h / raw integer seconds
feishu_group_id = "oc_..."
message_template = "[HEARTBEAT_TICK project={project} ts={ts}] koder: run patrol, report drift, update STATUS.md if changed."
created_at = "..."
updated_at = "..."
```

### CLI: `heartbeat_config.py`

Manages the config and renders the launchd plist:

```
heartbeat_config.py set --project X [--cadence 10min] [--template "..."] [--enabled true|false]
heartbeat_config.py show --project X
heartbeat_config.py list
heartbeat_config.py render-plist --project X [--output ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clawseat.heartbeat.X.plist]
heartbeat_config.py validate --project X
```

`set` without `--feishu-group-id` auto-pulls from project binding metadata.
`set` warns (to stderr) when the bound group has `feishu_external = true`.

### launchd plist

Generated by `render-plist` from `scripts/launchd/com.clawseat.heartbeat.plist.template`.
The operator runs `launchctl load` manually — C12 never does this itself.

### koder integration (optional reverse channel)

Active only when `scripts/apply-koder-overlay.sh` has been applied. Koder's
`SKILL.md` Heartbeat reception section describes:

1. Parse `[HEARTBEAT_TICK project=X ts=T]` header.
2. Read recent state.db events.
3. Run drift scan (STATUS.md mtime, in-flight tasks).
4. Post `[HEARTBEAT_ACK ...]` reply to the Feishu group.
5. If drift: surface to user via Feishu + `tmux send-keys` into the
   `<project>-planner` session to create a planner handoff.

### Why not a Python subscriber?

`heartbeat_beacon.sh` runs on the operator's laptop in a launchd context where
pulling Python + ClawSeat libs would require a venv on the host machine. Bash +
lark-cli is sufficient for a one-line message send. The Python tooling
(`heartbeat_config.py`) is only used interactively for config management.

## §3f — Profile regeneration discipline (C14)

### Problem

Bootstrap and reconfigure paths write the profile TOML from a hardcoded
template. Any field the operator hand-edited is silently overwritten on
the next regeneration — no warning, no diff, no preserve. This burned us
twice: `feishu_group_id` (fixed in C2 by moving to project binding metadata)
and `heartbeat_transport = "openclaw"` (clobbered back to `"tmux"`,
triggering a phantom tmux session the operator had to manually kill).

### Solution

`render_profile_preserving_operator_edits(target_path, fresh_payload, ...)` in
`core/scripts/agent_admin_workspace.py` reads the existing profile (if any),
and for every field in `PRESERVE_FIELDS` that the operator has set, uses the
existing value instead of the fresh template value. It emits one `stderr`
warning line per divergent field so the operator can see what was preserved.

All profile write paths now go through this helper instead of a direct
`write_text(template_text)`.

### Preservation allowlist

```python
PRESERVE_FIELDS = (
    "heartbeat_transport",  # "tmux" / "openclaw" — the regression source
    "heartbeat_owner",
    "seats",
    "heartbeat_seats",
    "default_start_seats",
    "materialized_seats",
    "runtime_seats",
    "bootstrap_seats",
    "active_loop_owner",
    "default_notify_target",
    "feishu_group_id",     # pre-C2 profiles only
    "seat_roles",          # entire sub-dict
    "seat_overrides",      # each nested sub-dict
    "dynamic_roster",
    "patrol",
    "observability",
)
```

Extra fields in the existing file (not known to the template) are also
carried forward so future schema extensions don't silently disappear.

### Escape hatch

If an operator truly wants to reset to factory defaults: delete the profile
file first, then run `cs init --refresh-profile`. With no existing file,
the fresh template is written verbatim.

### TOML serialization

`_serialize_profile_toml(data)` provides a minimal stdlib-only TOML
serializer for the profile schema (scalars, lists, nested tables up to two
levels deep). Comments from the template are not preserved on re-write —
this is an accepted trade-off since the runtime behavior is unchanged.

## §3g — Modal detector: closing the seat-observability gap (C10.5)

### The problem

The C8–C14 event bus knew when tasks were dispatched, completed, or had
Feishu closeouts. What it couldn't see: a seat silently frozen on a
Claude Code numbered-choice modal. No heartbeat divergence. No event row.
Just a frozen pane the operator had to manually discover.

### Design

```
modal_detector (launchd timer, every 60 s)
  └── tmux capture-pane for every live session
        └── _detect_modal() — regex on "Do you want to proceed?" + numbered list
              └── record_event_if_new('seat.blocked_on_modal', fingerprint=…)
                    └── feishu_announcer picks it up on next cycle
                          └── Feishu ping: "install/builder-2 blocked on modal"
```

`modal_detector.py` is a read-only observer. It never clicks, never sends
key input to the pane. Auto-click is deferred to C18 with a strict
allow-list.

### Pattern

The CC v2.x modal looks like:

```
Do you want to proceed?
❯ 1. Yes
  2. Yes, and allow hooks/ access
  3. No
```

`MODAL_PATTERN` matches: `"Do you want to proceed?" line` followed by
`2+ lines of the form [❯] <N>. <text>`. The `❯` marker (cursor position)
is optional — CC sometimes omits it.

### Fingerprint dedup

`_fingerprint(session, question, options)` → `sha1[:16]`. The same stuck
modal scanned every 60 s produces the same fingerprint, so
`record_event_if_new` inserts exactly one `seat.blocked_on_modal` event
per unique modal instance. When the operator resolves it and a new modal
appears, the new text generates a new fingerprint → new event.

### feishu_announcer integration

`_DEFAULT_EVENT_TYPES` in `feishu_announcer.py` was extended to include
`"seat.blocked_on_modal"`. No other changes to the announcer or state.py.

---

## §3h — Dispatch notify: default-ON (C15)

### Problem

`dispatch_task.py` had `--skip-notify` as an opt-out flag, but several
call paths silently suppressed notification even when the flag was absent
(driven by `profile.heartbeat_transport` branch conditions and other logic).
The result: planners routinely dispatched without notifying the target, which
then sat idle until a human manually nudged it.

### Design

Notify is default-ON. Callers opt **out** with `--no-notify`. A deprecated
`--skip-notify` alias is kept for backwards compatibility and emits a
deprecation warning on stderr when used.

```
--notify         # explicit (same as default)
--no-notify      # opt-out
--skip-notify    # [deprecated] use --no-notify
```

`add_notify_args(parser)` and `resolve_notify(args)` are shared helpers
in `_common.py` and re-exported via `dynamic_common.py` so both static
scripts (`dispatch_task.py`, `complete_handoff.py`) and dynamic variants
(`dispatch_task_dynamic.py`, `complete_handoff_dynamic.py`) share a single
implementation — preventing the drift that caused the original bug.

### Invariant

When `do_notify=True`, the notify call is **always** made regardless of
`profile.heartbeat_transport`. The transport affects the delivery mechanism
(tmux vs OpenClaw), not whether notification happens. The `notified_at`
field in the receipt JSON is the observable indicator.

---

## §3i — Seat context-usage watermark (C16)

### Problem

When a seat accumulates ~478k tokens mid-task (as happened with builder-2
during C10), the session becomes too full to process further tasks, but no
patrol alert fires and no Feishu ping is sent. The operator only notices when
manually checking why a task chain has stalled.

### Design

C16 embeds a **token_usage_pct** measurement in every HEARTBEAT_RECEIPT.toml.
When the patrol supervisor reads a receipt with `pct >= 0.80`, it emits a
`seat.context_near_limit` event into state.db. feishu_announcer picks it up
and sends a Feishu alert.

**Receipt schema v2:**
```toml
version = 2                          # bumped from v1
token_usage_pct = 0.37               # 0..1; absent = unknown
token_usage_source = "session_jsonl_size"  # cc_env | session_jsonl_size | unknown
token_usage_measured_at = "..."      # ISO8601
```

Pre-C16 receipts (version=1) missing these fields are read as
`token_usage_pct = None` → no alert fired. Backwards-compatible.

### Measurement heuristic

Sources tried in order:
1. **`CC_CONTEXT_USAGE_PCT` env var** — forward-compat hook for if CC ever
   exposes context usage natively.
2. **session.jsonl file size** — Claude Code logs each turn to a `.jsonl`
   file under `<runtime_dir>/<sandbox-home>/projects/-hash-/session.jsonl`.
   `approx_tokens = size_bytes / 8` (1 token ≈ 8 bytes including JSON
   overhead; safe upper bound). `pct = min(1.0, approx_tokens / max_tokens)`.
   `max_tokens` defaults to 200k (sonnet/opus); 1M for Opus 1M variants.
3. **Fallback** — `(None, "unknown")` if no file found or any error occurs.

~30% error bar. Intended to catch egregious cases (75%+), not pixel-accurate.

### Escalation chain

```
patrol_supervisor.py reads receipt
  → pct >= 0.80
  → state.record_event("seat.context_near_limit", ...)
  → events_watcher.py ingests
  → feishu_announcer.py relays to Feishu group
```

### Threshold

Hardcoded at `0.80` in `patrol_supervisor._CONTEXT_THRESHOLD`. Not
configurable in C16 — a follow-up (C19 candidate) can add per-seat overrides
and an auto-clear path at 0.95.

## §3j — Auth-mode operational migration (A1)

Six Claude seats inherited `auth_mode=oauth` from the initial install.
The per-seat sandbox HOME means each seat has its own Keychain slot; an
expired Anthropic OAuth session blocks that seat with an interactive popup
that automation cannot dismiss (upstream issue
[anthropics/claude-code#8938](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/8938)).

### Target mapping

| Project | Seat | auth_mode | provider |
|---------|------|-----------|----------|
| install | koder | oauth_token | anthropic |
| install | planner | oauth_token | anthropic |
| install | builder-1 | oauth_token | anthropic |
| install | builder-2 | api | anthropic-console |
| myproject | planner | oauth_token | anthropic |
| audit | builder-1 | api | anthropic-console |

`oauth_token` uses a 1-year Keychain-free token from `claude setup-token`
(set via `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`). `api/anthropic-console` uses a
Claude Code scoped `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from Anthropic Console (no
browser popup, no expiry).

### New provider: `anthropic-console`

Added to `SUPPORTED_RUNTIME_MATRIX["claude"]["api"]` in
`agent_admin_config.py`. Wired in `agent_admin_resolve.build_runtime`:
reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the seat's secret file, sets it in the
env, and defensively unsets `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. Uses default `api.anthropic.com` endpoint
(no base-URL override).

### Migration script

`core/scripts/migrate_seat_auth.py` — operator-run one-shot script:

```
migrate-seat-auth plan               # print current → proposed mapping
migrate-seat-auth apply --dry-run    # show agent-admin commands, no changes
migrate-seat-auth apply              # execute migration
```

Preflight checks:
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` present in `~/.agents/.env.global` (or `koder.env`)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` present in `~/.agents/secrets/claude/anthropic-console.env`

Both missing → exit 2 with operator-facing instructions.

Apply is idempotent: seats already at target state are skipped.
After apply, operator restarts affected tmux sessions; the new env takes
effect on the next seat launch.

## §3k — P1 layered-engine implementation notes (v0.4)

Binding spec: `docs/schemas/v0.4-layered-model.md`. Phase 1 delivered the
**engine** — parsers, validator, and operator-facing `agent-admin` commands.
The v0.7→v2 profile migration has since completed; operators should use
`scripts/install.sh --reinstall <project>` to regenerate a canonical v2 profile.

### Module map

| Code path | Owns | Schema ref |
|---|---|---|
| `core/lib/machine_config.py` | `MachineConfig` dataclass, load/write, auto-discovery of tenant workspaces, `validate_tenant` | §3 |
| `core/lib/profile_validator.py` | `ValidationResult`, `validate_profile_v2`, `validate_machine_config`, `write_validated` (raises `ProfileValidationError`) | §7 |
| `core/scripts/agent_admin_layered.py` | Four new subcommands (below) | §3 / §4 / §5 |

### `agent-admin` subcommands added in P1

| Command | Validates | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `project koder-bind --project X --tenant Y` | tenant ∈ machine.toml openclaw_tenants; tenant workspace exists | tenant workspace project metadata **and** project-local extras `openclaw_frontstage_tenant = Y` — atomic-ish (tenant metadata rolls back on binding-write failure) |
| `machine memory show` | — | — (read-only: prints memory service + tmux runtime probe) |
| `project seat list --project X` | — | — (reads v2 profile, expands `parallel_instances` per §8 → `{role}` singleton or `{role}_{n}` fan-out) |
| `project validate --project X` | `validate_profile_v2` over the project's profile | — (rc=0 ok, rc=1 errors) |

### Seat expansion rule (§8)

`parallel_instances = N` on worker roles such as `builder` materialises
tmux seats `{role}_{1..N}` (1-indexed). `N == 1` keeps the bare role
name — matches today's per-role-single topology so existing
`dispatch_task.py --target-role <role>` behavior is preserved without
change (state.db's `pick_least_busy_seat` handles the fan-out
transparently).

### Backup & rollback contract (§6)

The historical v0.7→v2 migration command has been retired. Re-running
`scripts/install.sh --reinstall <project>` is now the canonical recovery path;
it writes the current v2 profile shape directly instead of applying a legacy
mutation layer.

### Parallel-development seam (Phase 1)

`agent_admin_layered` imports the machine + validator layers defensively so the
CLI can surface a clear error if the validation layer is unavailable.

### Cross-validation gate

Opening a v2 profile cross-validates three things (§4/§5):

1. `profile.openclaw_frontstage_agent` is a key in
   `machine.toml [openclaw_tenants.*]`.
2. `workspace-<agent>` project metadata equals
   `profile.project_name`.
3. project-local extras `openclaw_frontstage_tenant` (if set)
   matches the profile's agent.

Any mismatch is a hard validation error. The error message includes the
exact fix: `agent-admin project koder-bind --project X --tenant Y`.

### Out of scope (deferred to Phase 2)

- Migrating existing project profiles to the new schema.
- Creating `~/.clawseat/machine.toml` on operator machines (still
  auto-discovered + written on first load by `machine_config.load_machine`).
- TUI / interactive wizard — consumes the validator seam per §9.
- Subagent fan-out docs (Phase 4).

## Non-Goals

ClawSeat should not contain the product source trees of its consumers.

These stay out of the framework repo:

- full consumer product source trees
- full `openclaw` source
- unrelated workspace artifacts
