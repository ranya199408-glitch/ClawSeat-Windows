"""ClawSeat v3 profile loader extension.

Reads [mode] and [teams] metadata from project.toml on top of the existing
flat seats/seat_roles/seat_overrides layout. Single-team projects are
transparent (mode absent or team_structure='single').

This is a *thin* metadata reader. It deliberately does NOT replace the
canonical loader at core/skills/gstack-harness/scripts/_common/profile.py —
it sits alongside as an additive reader that the multi-team helpers
(queue_io, agent_admin brief, install.sh multi render) consult.

See spec §4.1, §15 (install-spec-2026-05-13-clawseat-v3-multi-team-protocol.md).
